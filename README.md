# API Security Platform 🔒

A production-ready security scanning platform that helps engineering teams continuously monitor APIs for vulnerabilities, track security findings, and ensure compliance.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Modern applications expose numerous APIs that can be vulnerable to attacks. Manual security testing doesn't scale, and existing tools are often too complex for development teams. This platform bridges the gap by providing:

- **Automated API security scanning**
- **Centralized vulnerability management** 
- **Team collaboration features**
- **CI/CD integration capabilities**

## 🛠️ Planned Features

### Security Scanner (Week 1)
- [ ] Multi-threaded vulnerability scanning
- [ ] SQL injection, XSS, JWT analysis
- [ ] Professional reporting with risk scoring
- [ ] Concurrent scanning with progress tracking

### Management Dashboard (Week 2)  
- [ ] Web-based security dashboard
- [ ] Scan scheduling and monitoring
- [ ] Team collaboration and assignment
- [ ] Real-time progress updates

## 🏗️ Architecture

Our API Security Scanner uses a modular architecture:

- **Security Scanner**: Coordinates the scanning process
- **HTTP Client**: Handles all API communication  
- **Vulnerability Detectors**: Specialized modules for different vulnerability types
- **Report Generator**: Creates professional security reports
