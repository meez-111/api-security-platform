# SYSTEM DESIGN

## ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
A Python-based API security scanner that automatically tests web APIs for common vulnerabilities and generates professional security reports.

## CORE COMPONENTS

### SECURITY SCANNER (Orchestrator)
- **Purpose**: Coordinate the entire scanning process
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Manage scan configuration and targets
  - Coordinate between HTTP client and vulnerability detectors
  - Collect and aggregate results
  - Handle errors and timeouts

### HTTP CLIENT
- **Purpose**: Handle all HTTP communication with target APIs
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Send HTTP requests with various payloads
  - Handle retries, timeouts, and rate limiting
  - Manage cookies and sessions
  - Respect target API rate limits

### VULNERABILITY DETECTORS
- **Purpose**: Detect specific types of security vulnerabilities
- **Responsibilities**:
  - SQL Injection Detector: Test for database vulnerabilities
  - XSS Detector: Test for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities  
  - JWT Analyzer: Check for weak JWT implementations
  - Security Header Checker: Verify security headers

### REPORT GENERATOR
- **Purpose**: Create professional security reports
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Generate HTML reports with risk scores
  - Create JSON output for integration
  - Format findings with evidence and remediation advice

## DATA FLOW
1. User provides target API endpoints and scan configuration
2. Security Scanner validates targets and creates scan plan
3. HTTP Client sends requests to target APIs with test payloads
4. Vulnerability Detectors analyze responses for vulnerability patterns
5. Results are collected, risk-scored, and aggregated
6. Report Generator creates professional security reports

## TECHNOLOGY STACK
- **Python**: Core scanning language (extensive security libraries)
- **Requests**: HTTP client library (simple, reliable)
- **Jinja2**: HTML report templating
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and configuration

## DESIGN DECISIONS

### Why Separate Components?
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easy to test individual parts
- Can replace one component without affecting others

### Why This Data Flow?
- Clear separation between testing and reporting
- Easy to add new vulnerability detectors
- Scalable for handling multiple targets
